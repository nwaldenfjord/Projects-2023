This is the thesis for my bachelor, written together with Albert Sedwall. The goal was to create a Random Forest model to predict the risk of Periodontitis in a persons teeth by using patient data. Ihe optimal was to find a model that didn't need any advanced patient data, hence a very restricted model but it turned out to be hard to get good predictions with only those variables.
